                rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as
                an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it

                development community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties, fewer dependencies, and new
                technologies across more modern browsers.</p>

                breaking changes as
                possible. We improved existing features and components, removed support for older browsers, dropped
                jQuery for regular JavaScript, and embraced more future-friendly technologies like CSS custom properties
